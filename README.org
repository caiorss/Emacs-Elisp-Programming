* Emacs - Elisp Programming and Customization
** Overview

[[file:images/emacs_logo.png][file:images/emacs_logo.png]]


Emacs doesn't need any presentation. Emacs is a software [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_machine]["Lisp
Machine"]] that provides a programmable text editor, email reader, text
web browser, image viwer, calculator, shell, games, easter-eggs and
more.  Emacs is programmed in Elisp, an Emacs own lisp dialect that is
based on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maclisp][MacLisp]], one of oldest lisp dialects, older than Common Lisp
and Scheme, created in MIT. Emacs was written in 1976 by the legendary
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman][Richard Stallman]]. Despite many incompatibilities with Common Lisp it
has many constructs similar to it and n excellent book about Common
Lisp that is also useful to understand Elisp and Scheme is [[http://unintelligible.org/onlisp/onlisp.html][On Lisp - by Paul Graham]].

Note:

 - It is a work in progress.
 - You can see this document inside Emacs since it was converted to
   org-mode, see the file *README.org*. It can also be exported to
   html, pdf, github markdown and so on.

*Configuration File*

The user configuration file, which is executed when Emacs starts, is stored in the directory
=~/.emacs.d/init.el= or =~/.emacs=. The first one is better because it
is in the same directory of all emacs configuration files.

The Emacs scratch buffer can be used to test new features and try
Emacs codes along with IELM - Emacs Lisp interactive shell.

*Emacs Features*

 - Run in GUI or in terminal.
 - Programmable "text editor" (Lisp Machine)
 - Support to many programming languages
 - Can run shells and interpreters inside Emacs. 
 - Highly customizable
 - Easy task automation 
 - Package manager 
 - Multiple OS support
 - Remote file editting through ssh. (Tramp mode)
 - Keyboard macros
 - Utilities
   - Calculator
   - Eshell
   - Tramp-mode - Edit remote files and edit as super user (sudo).
   - Shells
   - File manager (dired-mode)
   - Git interface (magit)

*Objectives* 

 - Increase Emacs discoverability

 - Empower Emacs users to create their own extensions and
   customization

 - Provide self-contained working examples about Emacs API and Elisp
   programming.
