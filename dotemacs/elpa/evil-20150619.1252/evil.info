1 Overview
**********

Evil is an extensible vi layer for Emacs.  It emulates the main features
of Vim,(1) turning Emacs into a modal editor.  Like Emacs in general,
Evil is extensible in Emacs Lisp.

* Menu:

* Installation::
* Modes and states::

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Vim is the most popular version of "vi", a modal text editor with
many implementations.  Vim also adds some functions of its own, like
Visual selection and text objects.  For more information, see:
<http://www.vim.org/>


File: evil.info,  Node: Installation,  Next: Modes and states,  Up: Overview

1.1 Installation
================

Evil lives in a Git repository.  To download Evil, do:

     git clone git://gitorious.org/evil/evil.git

Move Evil to '~/.emacs.d/evil'.  Then add the following lines to
'~/.emacs':

     (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/evil")
     (require 'evil)
     (evil-mode 1)

Evil requires 'undo-tree.el' to provide linear undo and undo branches.
It is available from EmacsWiki.(1)  (A copy of 'undo-tree.el' is also
included in the Git repository.)

File: evil.info,  Node: Modes and states,  Prev: Installation,  Up: Overview

1.2 Modes and states
====================

The next time Emacs is started, it will come up in "Normal state",
denoted by '<N>' on the mode line.  This is where the main vi bindings
are defined.  Note that you can always disable Normal state with 'C-z',
which switches to an "Emacs state" (denoted by '<E>') in which vi keys
are completely disabled.  Press 'C-z' again to switch back to Normal
state.

   Evil uses the term "state" for what is called a "mode" in vi, since
"mode" already has its own meaning in Emacs.  Evil defines a number of
states, such as Normal state ('<N>'), Insert state ('<I>'), Visual state
('<V>'), Replace state ('<R>'), Operator-Pending state ('<O>'), Motion
state ('<M>') and Emacs state ('<E>').  Each state has its own keymaps
and customization variables.

   Meanwhile, a "mode" in Emacs is a set of key bindings for editing a
certain sort of text, like 'emacs-lisp-mode' for Emacs Lisp.  Modes may
include custom bindings for Evil states.

2 Settings
**********

Evil's behavior can be adjusted by setting various variables.  The
current values may be inspected by doing 'M-x customize-group RET evil
RET'.

   To change the value of a variable, add a 'setq' form to '~/.emacs',
preferably before Evil is loaded:(1)

     (setq evil-shift-width 8)
     ;; Load Evil
     (require 'evil) ...

Note that if a variable is buffer-local, you must use 'setq-default'
instead of 'setq' to change its global value.

 -- Variable: evil-auto-indent
     Whether the current line is indented when entering Insert state.
     If 't' (the default), then the line is indented.  If 'nil', then
     the line is not indented.  Buffer-local.

 -- Variable: evil-shift-width
     The number of columns a line is shifted by the commands '>' and
     '<'.

 -- Variable: evil-repeat-move-cursor
     If 't' (the default), then repeating a command with '.' may change
     the position of the cursor.  If 'nil', then the original position
     is preserved.

 -- Variable: evil-find-skip-newlines
     If 't', then 'f', 'F', 't' and 'T' may skip over newlines to find a
     character.  If 'nil' (the default), then they are restricted to the
     current line.

 -- Variable: evil-move-cursor-back
     If 't' (the default), then the cursor moves backwards when exiting
     Insert state.  If 'nil', then the cursor does not move.

 -- Variable: evil-want-fine-undo
     If 't', then a change-based action like 'cw' may be undone in
     several steps.  If 'nil' (the default), then it is undone in one
     step.

 -- Variable: evil-regexp-search
     If 't' (the default), then '/' and '?' use regular expressions for
     searching.  If 'nil', they use plain text.

 -- Variable: evil-search-wrap
     If 't' (the default), then '/' and '?' wrap the search around the
     buffer.  If 'nil', then they stop at buffer boundaries.

 -- Variable: evil-flash-delay
     The number of seconds to flash search matches when pressing 'n' and
     'N'.

 -- Variable: evil-want-C-i-jump
     If 't' (the default), then 'C-i' jumps forwards in the jump list.
     If 'nil', then 'C-i' inserts a tab.

 -- Variable: evil-want-C-u-scroll
     If 't', then 'C-u' scrolls the buffer.  If 'nil' (the default),
     then 'C-u' begins a numeric prefix argument.

* Menu:

* The cursor::
* The initial state::

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Strictly speaking, the order only matters if the variable affects
the way Evil is loaded.  This is the case with some of the 'evil-want-'
variables.


File: evil.info,  Node: The cursor,  Next: The initial state,  Up: Settings

2.1 The cursor
==============

A state may change the cursor's appearance.  The cursor settings are
stored in the variables below, which may contain a cursor type as per
the 'cursor-type' variable, a color string as passed to the
'set-cursor-color' function, a zero-argument function for changing the
cursor, or a list of the above.  For example, the following changes the
cursor in Replace state to a red box:

     (setq evil-replace-state-cursor '("red" box))

If the state does not specify a cursor, 'evil-default-cursor' is used.

 -- Variable: evil-default-cursor
     The default cursor.

 -- Variable: evil-normal-state-cursor
     The cursor for Normal state.

 -- Variable: evil-insert-state-cursor
     The cursor for Insert state.

 -- Variable: evil-visual-state-cursor
     The cursor for Visual state.

 -- Variable: evil-replace-state-cursor
     The cursor for Replace state.

 -- Variable: evil-operator-state-cursor
     The cursor for Operator-Pending state.

 -- Variable: evil-motion-state-cursor
     The cursor for Motion state.

 -- Variable: evil-emacs-state-cursor
     The cursor for Emacs state.


File: evil.info,  Node: The initial state,  Prev: The cursor,  Up: Settings

2.2 The initial state
=====================

By default, a new buffer comes up in Normal state.  This can be changed
with the function 'evil-set-initial-state'.

 -- Function: evil-set-initial-state mode state
     Set the initial state for a buffer in which MODE is active to
     STATE.  MODE should be a major mode such as 'text-mode', although
     minor modes work as well.


File: evil.info,  Node: Keymaps,  Next: Hooks,  Prev: Settings,  Up: Top

3 Keymaps
*********

Evil's key bindings are stored in a number of keymaps.  Each state has a
"global keymap", where the default key bindings for the state are
stored.  For example, the global keymap for Normal state is
'evil-normal-state-map', and the key bindings in this map are seen in
all buffers that are currently in Normal state.

   Keymaps are modified with the Emacs function 'define-key':

     (define-key evil-normal-state-map "w" 'foo)

This binds the key 'w' to the command 'foo' in Normal state.  The file
'evil-maps.el' contains all the key bindings.

 -- Variable: evil-normal-state-map
     The global keymap for Normal state.

 -- Variable: evil-insert-state-map
     The global keymap for Insert state.

 -- Variable: evil-visual-state-map
     The global keymap for Visual state.

 -- Variable: evil-replace-state-map
     The global keymap for Replace state.

 -- Variable: evil-operator-state-map
     The global keymap for Operator-Pending state.

 -- Variable: evil-motion-state-map
     The global keymap for Motion state.

Each state also has a "buffer-local keymap", which is specific to the
current buffer and has precedence over the global keymap.  These maps
may be changed from a mode hook.

 -- Variable: evil-normal-state-local-map
     Buffer-local keymap for Normal state.

 -- Variable: evil-insert-state-local-map
     Buffer-local keymap for Insert state.

 -- Variable: evil-visual-state-local-map
     Buffer-local keymap for Visual state.

 -- Variable: evil-replace-state-local-map
     Buffer-local keymap for Replace state.

 -- Variable: evil-operator-state-local-map
     Buffer-local keymap for Operator-Pending state.

 -- Variable: evil-motion-state-local-map
     Buffer-local keymap for Motion state.

* Menu:

* 'evil-define-key'::


File: evil.info,  Node: 'evil-define-key',  Up: Keymaps

3.1 'evil-define-key'
=====================

Finally, Evil provides the function 'evil-define-key' for adding state
bindings to a regular keymap.

 -- Function: evil-define-key state keymap key def
     In KEYMAP, create a binding from KEY to DEF in STATE.  STATE is one
     of 'normal', 'insert', 'visual', 'replace', 'operator' and
     'motion'.  The other parameters are like those of 'define-key'.

'evil-define-key' can be used to augment existing modes with state
bindings, as well as create packages for custom bindings.  For example,
the following will create a minor mode 'foo-mode' with Normal state
bindings for the keys 'w' and 'e':

     (define-minor-mode foo-mode
       "Foo mode."
       :keymap (make-sparse-keymap))

     (evil-define-key 'normal foo-mode-map "w" 'bar)
     (evil-define-key 'normal foo-mode-map "e" 'baz)

This minor mode can then be enabled in any buffers where the custom
bindings are desired:

     (add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'foo-mode) ; enable alongside 'text-mode'

If the minor mode is put into its own file 'foo.el' with a '(provide
'foo)' statement, it becomes an Emacs package.


File: evil.info,  Node: Hooks,  Next: Macros,  Prev: Keymaps,  Up: Top

4 Hooks
*******

A "hook" is a list of functions to execute.  Hooks are modified with the
Emacs function 'add-hook'.  Evil provides entry and exit hooks for all
of its states.

 -- Variable: evil-normal-state-entry-hook
     Run when entering Normal state.

 -- Variable: evil-normal-state-exit-hook
     Run when exiting Normal state.

 -- Variable: evil-insert-state-entry-hook
     Run when entering Insert state.

 -- Variable: evil-insert-state-exit-hook
     Run when exiting Insert state.

 -- Variable: evil-visual-state-entry-hook
     Run when entering Visual state.

 -- Variable: evil-visual-state-exit-hook
     Run when exiting Visual state.

 -- Variable: evil-replace-state-entry-hook
     Run when entering Replace state.

 -- Variable: evil-replace-state-exit-hook
     Run when exiting Replace state.

 -- Variable: evil-operator-state-entry-hook
     Run when entering Operator-Pending state.

 -- Variable: evil-operator-state-exit-hook
     Run when exiting Operator-Pending state.

 -- Variable: evil-motion-state-entry-hook
     Run when entering Motion state.

 -- Variable: evil-motion-state-exit-hook
     Run when exiting Motion state.

When these hooks are run, the variables 'evil-next-state' and
'evil-previous-state' hold information about the states being switched
to and from.

 -- Variable: evil-next-state
     The state being switched to.

 -- Variable: evil-previous-state
     The state being switched from.

5 Macros
********

Evil is implemented in terms of reusable macros.  Package writers can
use these to define new commands.

* Menu:

* Motions::
* Operators::
* Text objects::
* Types::
* States::


File: evil.info,  Node: Motions,  Next: Operators,  Up: Macros

5.1 Motions
===========

A "motion" is a command which moves the cursor, such as 'w' and 'e'.
Motions are defined with the macro 'evil-define-motion'.  Motions not
defined in this way should be declared with 'evil-declare-motion'.

 -- Function: evil-declare-motion command
     Declare COMMAND to be a motion.  This ensures that it works
     properly in Visual state.

 -- Macro: evil-define-motion motion (count args...) doc keyword-args...
          body...
     Define a movement command MOTION.  A motion can have any number of
     arguments, but the first argument, if any, has a predefined meaning
     as the COUNT.  It is a positive or negative number, or 'nil'.  The
     argument list is followed by the documentation string DOC, which is
     followed by optional keyword arguments:

     ':type TYPE'
          The TYPE determines how the motion works after an operator.
          If TYPE is 'inclusive', then the ending position is included
          in the motion range.  If TYPE is 'line', then the range is
          expanded to linewise positions.  If TYPE is 'block', then the
          range is blockwise.  The default is 'exclusive', which means
          that the range is used as-is.

     ':jump JUMP'
          If JUMP is 't', then the previous position is stored in the
          jump list so it can be restored with 'C-o'.  The default is
          'nil'.

     The keyword arguments are followed by the BODY, which is where the
     motion's behavior is defined.  For instance:

          (evil-define-motion foo-forward (count)
            "Move to the right by COUNT characters."
            :type inclusive
            (forward-char (or count 1)))

     For more examples, you can view the source code for any command
     with 'C-h k'.  For instance, 'evil-goto-line' may be viewed by
     typing 'C-h k G' and following the file link.


File: evil.info,  Node: Operators,  Next: Text objects,  Prev: Motions,  Up: Macros

5.2 Operators
=============

An "operator" is a command which acts on the text moved over by a
motion, such as 'c', 'd' and 'y'.  Operators are defined with the macro
'evil-define-operator'.

 -- Macro: evil-define-operator operator (beg end type args...) doc
          keyword-args... body...
     Define an operator command OPERATOR.  An operator must have at
     least two or three arguments, which have predefined meanings.  BEG
     is the beginning position, END is the ending position, and TYPE, if
     given, is the type of the motion range.  The argument list is
     followed by the documentation string DOC, which is followed by
     optional keyword arguments:

     ':type TYPE'
          Make the input range be a certain TYPE.  For example, an
          operator which only works with whole lines may set TYPE to
          'line'.

     ':motion MOTION'
          Use the motion MOTION instead of reading one from the
          keyboard.  This does not affect the behavior in Visual state,
          where the selection boundaries are used instead.

     ':repeat REPEAT'
          If REPEAT is 't' (the default), then '.' will repeat the
          operator.  If REPEAT is 'nil', then the operator will not be
          repeated.

     ':move-point MOVE-POINT'
          If MOVE-POINT is 't' (the default), then the cursor is
          positioned at the beginning of the range.  If MOVE-POINT is
          'nil', then the original position is preserved.

     ':keep-visual KEEP-VISUAL'
          If KEEP-VISUAL is 't', then the selection is not disabled when
          the operator is run in Visual state; it is up to the operator
          to do this.  The default is 'nil', which means that Visual
          state is exited automatically.

     The keyword arguments are followed by the BODY, which is where the
     operator's actions on BEG and END are defined.  For example,
     'evil-rot13', which is bound to 'g?' and performs ROT13 encryption
     on the text, may be defined as:

          (evil-define-operator evil-rot13 (beg end)
            "ROT13 encrypt text."
            (rot13-region beg end))

     Pressing 'g?w' will encrypt a word by calling 'rot13-region' on the
     text moved over by the 'w' motion.


File: evil.info,  Node: Text objects,  Next: Types,  Prev: Operators,  Up: Macros

5.3 Text objects
================

A "text object" is a special kind of motion which sets a beginning
position as well as an ending position, such as 'iw' and 'a('.  In
Visual state, text objects alter both ends of the selection.  Text
objects are defined with the macro 'evil-define-text-object'.

 -- Macro: evil-define-text-object object (count args...) doc
          keyword-args... body...
     Define a text object OBJECT.  The first argument has a predefined
     meaning as the COUNT: it is a positive or negative number.  The
     argument list is followed by the documentation string DOC, which is
     followed by optional keyword arguments:

     ':type TYPE'
          Use the type TYPE after an operator.  In Visual state, this is
          the type of the selection.

     ':extend-selection EXTEND-SELECTION'
          If EXTEND-SELECTION is 't' (the default), then the text object
          always enlarges the current selection.  If 'nil', then the
          object replaces the selection.

     The keyword arguments are followed by the BODY, which should
     evaluate to a list '(BEG END)' of two positions in the buffer.  For
     example, a text object which selects three characters following the
     current position could be defined as:

          (evil-define-text-object foo (count)
            "Select three characters."
            (list (point) (+ (point) 3)))

Evil provides several functions which return a list of positions, for
use in the definition of a text object.  These functions follow the rule
that a positive COUNT selects text after the current position, while a
negative COUNT selects text before it.

 -- Function: evil-inner-object-range count forward backward
     Return a text range '(BEG END)' of COUNT "inner" text objects
     (e.g., 'iw', 'is').  FORWARD is a function which moves to the end
     of an object, and BACKWARD is a function which moves to the
     beginning.

 -- Function: evil-an-object-range count forward backward
     Return a text range '(BEG END)' of COUNT text objects with
     whitespace (e.g., 'aw', 'as').  FORWARD is a function which moves
     to the end of an object, and BACKWARD is a function which moves to
     the beginning.

 -- Function: evil-paren-range count open close &optional exclusive
     Return a text range '(BEG END)' of COUNT delimited blocks (e.g.,
     'i(', 'a(').  OPEN and CLOSE are characters.  If EXCLUSIVE is
     non-nil, then the delimiters are excluded from the range.  This
     function uses Emacs' syntax table and is only applicable for
     single-character delimiters; use 'evil-regexp-range' to match
     multiple characters.

 -- Function: evil-regexp-range count open close &optional exclusive
     Return a text range '(BEG END)' of COUNT delimited blocks (e.g.,
     'it', 'at').  OPEN and CLOSE are regular expressions.  If EXCLUSIVE
     is non-nil, then the delimiters are excluded from the range.


File: evil.info,  Node: Types,  Next: States,  Prev: Text objects,  Up: Macros

5.4 Types
=========

A "type" is a transformation on a pair of buffer positions.  Evil
defines the types 'exclusive', 'inclusive', 'line' and 'block', which
are used for motion ranges and Visual selection.  Types are defined with
the macro 'evil-define-type'.

 -- Macro: evil-define-type type doc keyword-args...
     Define a type TYPE, described by the documentation string DOC.
     Then follows keyword arguments:

     ':expand EXPAND'
          A function which takes two buffer positions and returns a list
          '(BEG END)' of expanded positions.

     ':contract CONTRACT'
          A function which takes two expanded buffer positions and
          returns a list '(BEG END)' of unexpanded positions.  Optional.

     ':normalize NORMALIZE'
          A function which takes two unexpanded buffer positions and
          returns a list '(BEG END)' of adjusted positions.  Optional.

     ':injective INJECTIVE'
          If 't' (the default), then expansion is one-to-one - i.e.,
          EXPAND followed by CONTRACT always returns the original
          positions.  If 'nil', then several positions may expand to the
          same (for example, the 'line' type is one-to-many as it
          expands to the containing lines).

     Further keywords and functions may be specified.  These are
     understood to be transformations on buffer positions, like EXPAND
     and CONTRACT.


File: evil.info,  Node: States,  Prev: Types,  Up: Macros

5.5 States
==========

States are defined with the macro 'evil-define-state'.  The macro
defines the necessary hooks, keymaps and variables for a state, as well
as a toggle function 'evil-STATE-state' for entering the state, and a
predicate function 'evil-STATE-state-p' which returns 't' when the state
is active, and 'nil' otherwise.

 -- Macro: evil-define-state state doc keyword-args... body...
     Define an Evil state STATE, described by the documentation string
     DOC.  Then follows optional keyword arguments:

     ':tag TAG'
          Mode line indicitor, e.g., '"<T>"'.
     ':message MESSAGE'
          String shown in the echo area.
     ':cursor CURSOR'
          Cursor specification.
     ':enable ENABLE'
          List of other modes and states to enable.  A state may enable
          another state's keymaps in addition to its own.

     This is followed the BODY, which is executed whenever the state is
     enabled or disabled.  The state's predicate function may be used to
     distinguish between the two.

File: evil.info,  Node: Command properties,  Up: Other internals

6.1 Command properties
======================

Evil defines "command properties" to store information about commands,
such as whether they should be repeated.  A command property is a
':KEYWORD' with an associated value, e.g., ':repeat nil'.

 -- Function: evil-add-command-properties command &rest properties
     Add PROPERTIES to COMMAND.  The properties should be specified as a
     list of keywords and values:

          (evil-add-command-properties 'my-command :repeat t)

 -- Function: evil-set-command-properties command &rest properties
     Like 'evil-add-command-properties', but resets all previous
     properties.

 -- Function: evil-get-command-property command property
     Return the value of a command property.

 -- Macro: evil-define-command command (args...) doc keyword-args...
          body...
     Define a command with command properties KEYWORD-ARGS.

For setting repeat properties, Evil provides the following functions:

 -- Function: evil-declare-repeat command
     Declare COMMAND to be repeatable.

 -- Function: evil-declare-not-repeat command
     Declare COMMAND to be nonrepeatable.

 -- Function: evil-declare-change-repeat command
     Declare COMMAND to be repeatable by buffer changes rather than
     keystrokes.

     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the
     same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy can
     decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

  11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts."  line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.
